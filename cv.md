1. ***About me:***    
I am a well-qualified specialist in the field of foreign languages, but now my main goal is to become a good IT-specialist. I have already taken an online course in web-development (see below), read several books on the topic and currently I am studying at RS School. I already posses necessary soft skills and language competences, learning abilities and professional qualities (like indulgence, diligence, quick mind, etc.), and I expect that with the abovementioned sources I will obtain necessary hard skills.  
2. ***Relevant skills:*** HTML, CSS, JS.  
3. ***Sample code bit:***  
```
					function solution(number){  
						let numbers = [];  
						for (let i = 1; i <= number; i++) {  
						  if (i % 3 === 0 || i % 5 === 0) { numbers.push(i) }  
						}  
						numbers = Array.from(new Set(numbers));  
						return numbers.reduce((sum, current) => sum + current, 0);  
					}
```
